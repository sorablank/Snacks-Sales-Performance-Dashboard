# Snacks-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
As a business analyst, my goal for the Snacks Sales Performance Dashboard project was to analyze the sales data of a snacks company and create a dashboard to showcase the company's sales performance. The dataset contained information on the company's sales over the past year, including the employee ID, team, geographical location, product category, number of boxes sold, and revenue earned.

To begin the project, I imported the sales dataset into Power BI and used Power Query to clean and transform the data. I also created calculated columns and measures in DAX to derive additional insights
from the data.

Using the cleaned data, I designed a set of visualizations in Power BI to help stakeholders in the snacks company gain insights into their sales performance. I created a variety of charts, including a bar chart showing the total revenue earned by product category, a scatter chart comparing the number of boxes sold to the revenue earned, and a map chart displaying the geographical location of the customers.

To further enhance the visualizations, I added filters and slicers to enable users to interact with the data and customize their own analyses. I also created a drill-through capability that allowed stakeholders to explore the sales data in more detail by clicking on a specific data point in a visualization.

To make the dashboard more user-friendly, I categorized the employees by teams and created a chart showing the total revenue earned by each team. Additionally, I categorized the geographical locations of the customers by country and created a chart showing the total revenue earned by each country.
